## Repository Title
Bug-and-code-refactor-and-enhancement

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of datasets and responses from various large language models (LLMs) that we have tested. The purpose of this repository is to document the input data provided to each model, as well as the outputs generated by these models. This can help in comparative analysis, further research, model training enhancements, or reproducibility studies.

## Models
This section lists the large language models included in this study, along with a brief description of each:

GitHub Copilot: Developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI, Copilot is powered by the Codex model. It assists in writing code by suggesting whole lines or blocks of code as developers work.

GPT-3: Created by OpenAI, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is one of the most advanced language processing AI models, known for its ability to generate human-like text based on the input it is given.

GPT-4 (Grimoire): An evolution of GPT-3, GPT-4 (referred to in this repository as Grimoire) offers refined capabilities and improved performance in generating text, making it even more potent in understanding and generating complex text based on minimal prompts.
