Your code seems to be trying to compare whether two arrays are equal.
 However, the comparison arr1 === arr2 will only return true if arr1 and arr2 refer to the exact same array object in memory,
  not if their contents are the same.
  To compare the contents of the arrays, you would typically iterate over each element and compare them individually.
   Here's a corrected version of your function:
```

function checkEquals(arr1, arr2) {
    // Check if arrays have the same length
    if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Iterate over each element and compare
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // If all elements are equal, return true
    return true;
}


```
This function iterates over each element in both arrays and checks for equality.
 If any elements differ or if the arrays have different lengths,
  it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
