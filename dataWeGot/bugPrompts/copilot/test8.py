"""
Your code is well-structured and the use of a loop to calculate the modulus is
a good approach. However, there are a few points to consider:

Functionality: The output of your function doesn’t match the examples you’ve
given. For instance, mod(7, 6) returns 0 in your example, but your function
would return a different result because of the calculation inside the loop.
Variable Naming: It’s a good practice to use descriptive variable names.
In your function, ran and key might not clearly convey what they represent.
Consider renaming them to something more descriptive.
Performance: The time complexity of your function is O(n), which could be
problematic for large inputs. You might need to use
an algorithm with better time complexity.
Here’s a revised version of your function that might work better:
"""


def mod(n, m):
    result = m - 6
    for i in range(n):
        result = ((result + 6) + 6 * i * (i + 2)) % m
    return result
