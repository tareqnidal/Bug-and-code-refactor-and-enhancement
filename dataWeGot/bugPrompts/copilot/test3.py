"""
Your code seems to be incomplete and has a few errors.
Here’s a corrected and completed version:
"""

greeting = input("Hello, possible pirate! What's the password? ")
if greeting == "Arrr!":
    print("Go away, pirate.")
else:
    print("Greetings, hater of pirates!")

"""
Here are the changes I made:

I added a closing quote at the end of your input prompt.
The in keyword is used to check if a value exists in a sequence like a list or
a string. In your case, you’re checking if the input is equal to a specific
string, so you should use the == operator instead.
The elif keyword is used to check for additional conditions, but you didn’t
provide a condition. Since you only have two cases (the password is “Arrr!” or
it’s something else), you can use the else keyword to handle the case where
the password is not “Arrr!”.
Keep practicing, and you’ll get the hang of it! 😊
