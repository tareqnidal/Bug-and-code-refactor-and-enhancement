"""
Your Python class definition for a Person has a few syntactic and logical
errors. Let’s address each issue and provide a corrected version:

Class Definition: The class name should be defined using
the keyword class, not classy.
Initialization Method: The constructor in Python
should be named __init__ instead of __initalize__.
Variable Names: The variable lname and fname are not defined;
it seems they were meant to be last_name and first_name respectively.
Method Definition: The indentation for the speak method
is incorrect, and there's a syntax error in the string concatenation.
Method Call: The speak method call for the you object
has a syntax error with an unnecessary self.
Here’s a corrected and improved version of your code:
"""


class Person:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name

    def speak(self):
        print("My name is", self.first_name, self.last_name)


me = Person("Brandon", "Walsh")
you = Person("Ethan", "Reed")

me.speak()
you.speak()


"""
Explanation of Changes:

Corrected the class definition and constructor name.
Fixed variable references to match the constructor parameters.
Updated the speak method for proper string output and fixed indentation.
Corrected the method call on the you object.
This revised class now correctly initializes a Person object with first and
last names and includes a speak method that outputs the person's full name.
