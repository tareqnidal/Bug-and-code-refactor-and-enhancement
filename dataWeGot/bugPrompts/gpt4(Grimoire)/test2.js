Looking at your JavaScript function checkEquals, which is intended to compare two arrays,
 it's important to note that using the strict equality operator (===) won't work as expected for array comparisons.
  This operator checks for reference equality rather than comparing the contents of the arrays.
   Therefore, even if two arrays contain identical elements, they will only be considered equal if they reference the exact same object in memory.
Hereâ€™s a revised version of your function that correctly checks if two arrays have the same elements in the same order:
```

function checkEquals(arr1, arr2) {
	if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
	  return false;
	}
	for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
	  if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) {
		return false;
	  }
	}
	return true;
  }

  
```
This version first checks if the arrays have the same length,
 and then it compares each element in sequence. If any element differs,
  it returns false. If all elements are the same, it returns true.
