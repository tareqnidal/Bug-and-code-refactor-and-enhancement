Your function checkEquals is intended to check if two arrays are equal.
 However, in JavaScript, using === to compare arrays checks if they are the same instance,
  not if they have the same values. This means that even if arr1 and arr2 contain the same values,
   arr1 === arr2 will return false unless they reference the exact same array.
Hereâ€™s a modified version of your function that checks if the two arrays have the same values in the same order:

```
function checkEquals(arr1, arr2) {
    if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

```
This function first checks if the arrays have the same length. If they donâ€™t,
 it returns false. Then it checks each corresponding pair of values in the two arrays.
  If it finds a pair that doesnâ€™t match, it returns false.
   If it gets through all the checks without finding any mismatches, it returns true. Keep coding! ðŸ˜Š
