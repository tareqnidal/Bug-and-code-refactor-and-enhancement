Your code is well-structured and the use of JavaScript’s map function to iterate over the containers 
is a good approach. However, there’s a crucial issue with your code: it’s related to how JavaScript handles object assignment.

In JavaScript, objects are reference types. When you do const newProduct = oldProduct,
you’re not creating a new copy of oldProduct. Instead, newProduct and oldProduct both
point to the same object in memory. So when you modify newProduct, you’re also modifying oldProduct.

To fix this issue, you can use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) trick to create a deep copy of the object:

```
function migrateProduct(oldProduct) {
    const newProduct = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(oldProduct));
    newProduct.price *= 1.15;
    newProduct.containers = newProduct.containers.map(container => {
        if (container.type === 'bottle') {
            container.deposit = 0.20;
        }
        return container;
    });
    
    return { oldProduct, newProduct };
}

```
This version of the function creates a new copy of oldProduct, so the original object 
isn’t modified when you change newProduct. Please note that the 
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) trick doesn’t work with all objects, but it should work fine 
in this case since you’re dealing with simple objects and arrays.
Remember to always test your code with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. Happy coding!
