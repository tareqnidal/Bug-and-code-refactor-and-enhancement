```
Your code is almost correct,
 but there seems to be a small typo. The keyword for returning
  a value in JavaScript is return, not retunr. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code: 
```
function cubes(a) {
	return a ** 3;
}

```
This function will now correctly return the cube of the input number a. Keep up the good work! ðŸ˜Š
