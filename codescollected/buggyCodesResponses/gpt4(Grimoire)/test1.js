```
It looks like your function intends to return the cube of a given number a,
 but there’s a typo in your return statement (retunr should be return). Here’s the corrected version of your code:
```

function cubes(a) {
    return a ** 3;
}


```
This function now correctly calculates the cube of the input a by using the exponentiation operator **,
 which is a neat and modern way to perform power calculations in JavaScript.
