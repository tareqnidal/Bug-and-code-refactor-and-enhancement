```
It looks like there's a small typo in your code. Instead of "retunr",
 it should be "return". Here's the corrected version:
```

function cubes(a) {
    return a ** 3;
}

```
Other than that, the function appears to be simple and straightforward.
 It takes a number as input and returns its cube using the exponentiation operator (**).
