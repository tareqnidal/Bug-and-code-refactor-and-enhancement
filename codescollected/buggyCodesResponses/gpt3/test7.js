Your code seems to aim to migrate a product by increasing its price and updating certain container properties.
 Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

Mutability: You're directly modifying the oldProduct object and assigning
 it to newProduct. This mutates the original object, which might lead to
  unexpected behavior if the original object is still needed elsewhere.
   It's better to create a new object for newProduct to keep the original intact.
Price Increase: The price increase is hard-coded (multiplied by 1.15).
 It's generally a good practice to avoid hard-coding values directly
  into the code. Consider making the price increase a parameter or a constant variable for better flexibility.
Container Update: Currently, you're updating the deposit for bottles only.
 If there are other containers that need updates in the future,
  you'll have to add more conditions. Consider making this part more flexible or scalable.
Mapping Containers: Mapping the containers array is fine,
 but it's important to note that you're mutating the objects within the array.
  While this doesn't cause issues in this specific case,
   it might be better to create new objects instead of mutating the existing ones for clarity and to avoid unexpected side effects.
Here's a modified version addressing these points:
```


function migrateProduct(oldProduct) {
    // Create a deep copy of oldProduct to avoid mutation
    const newProduct = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(oldProduct));
    
    // Define the price increase as a constant
    const priceIncreaseFactor = 1.15;
    newProduct.price *= priceIncreaseFactor;

    // Update containers
    newProduct.containers = newProduct.containers.map(container => {
        // Use a switch statement for more flexibility
        switch (container.type) {
            case 'bottle':
                container.deposit = 0.20;
                break;
            // Add cases for other container types if needed
            // case 'can':
            //     container.deposit = ...;
            //     break;
            default:
                // No action needed for other container types
                break;
        }
        return container; // Return the updated container
    });
    
    return { oldProduct, newProduct };
}

```
This version creates a deep copy of the oldProduct to ensure immutability, 
uses a constant for the price increase factor, 
and provides a more flexible approach for updating container properties.
