"""
Your code seems to be a Python script that checks for a password
in the input greeting. However, there are a couple of issues:

You're missing a closing quotation mark in the input function.
The list in the if condition has a syntax error.
It should be ["Arrr!"] instead of ["Arrr!)".
There's a syntax error with the elif statement.
Here's the corrected version:
"""

greeting = input("Hello, possible pirate! What's the password?")
if greeting in ["Arrr!"]:
    print("Go away, pirate.")
else:
    print("Greetings, hater of pirates!")

"""
In this corrected version:

The input function now has a closing quotation mark.
The list in the if condition contains the correct password "Arrr!".
The elif statement is replaced with else since it's not needed here.
If the greeting is not "Arrr!", it prints the alternative message.
